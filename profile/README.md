Hello All! I am proud to announce that CommunityCAD has now been put into beta and is ready to have communities use it. CommunityCAD is an all in one solution that handles everything you need to run your community. Applications? CHECK! Member rosters and activity tracking? CHECK! CAD/MDT Functionality? wait... CHCEK! DM me if you have any questions or are interested!

First let me tell you a little about the history. Playing FiveM for the last 8 years almost I haven't seen a community that has everything in one place. To apply to be a member you have to use this Google Form or worse ejin forms. Then you had to be whitelisted through something else. Then you had the CAD/MDT while department heads tried to keep track of Google Forms and Docs.

I wanted to change that. After multiple iterations and years of work I have finally finished a complete Version 1 that I wish to open to the public. I still haven't decided fully if it will be open source or a subscription based like other systems. This is a web based option so FiveM, Console, and Roblox roleplay communities can take advantage of this system. Its made with simple php so anyone can host it with cPanel very easily if I open source it or Subscription I will handle all hosting needs for you.

If you are interested in the system please feel free to DM me! Check out some ⁠features. I can set up a demo if you are further interested. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to reach out.

Screen shots do not include all features of the system and some design elements may have changed since the screenshot was taken. DM me if you are interested in a demo!
