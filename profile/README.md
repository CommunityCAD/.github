# About Community CAD

Hello All! I am proud to announce that Community CAD has now entered beta and is ready for communities to use. Community CAD is an all-in-one solution that handles everything you need to run your community:

- Applications? :white_check_mark:!
- Member rosters and activity tracking? :white_check_mark:!
- CAD/MDT Functionality? :white_check_mark:!

## History

Let me give you a bit of background. Having played FiveM for nearly 8 years, I've yet to come across a community with everything in one place. To apply to become a member, you typically had to use Google Forms or, worse, ejin forms. Then, you had to be whitelisted through another process. Meanwhile, department heads struggled to keep track of Google Forms and Docs.

I wanted to change that. After multiple iterations and years of work, I have finally completed Version 1 of a comprehensive solution that I'm excited to open to the public.  This is a web-based option, so FiveM, Console, and Roblox roleplay communities can take advantage of this system. 

*Note: Screenshots do not include all features of the system, and some design elements may have changed since the screenshot was taken. *
